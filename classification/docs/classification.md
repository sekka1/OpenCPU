## Classification

[Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) is
the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories a new observation
belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations whose
category membership is known. Thus it is considered an instance of supervised
learning.

An algorithm that implements classification, especially in a concrete
implementation, is known as a classifier. The term "classifier" sometimes also
refers to the mathematical function, implemented by a classification algorithm,
that maps input data to a category.
